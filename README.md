## About Data 📚
Used Kaggle’s Seattle Airbnb Open Data for Jan 2016.
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) you can find the dataset.


## Highlights✨

These are the few questions I have tried answering for anyone who looks forward to buying a property to rent out on Airbnb, they can make more data-centric choices now.

 >> 📌What is the Revenue generated through Air-Bnb business for each month for the year 2016?

We can see Year End is the time when you can expect the maximum revenue.

>> 📌What is the average rent you can expect from an Airbnb as per the Zip Codes available in Seattle?

Zipcode 98134 offers the maximum rent, whereas 98125 should be the least interested Zipcode from a business point of view.

>> 📌What is the average price as per the no of bedrooms available in the house you can rent your house on?

Buying a property with 1 Bedroom should be the last option, while on vacations people seek comfort, going for a 3–5 bedroom property would be the safest option.

>> 📌What is the average rent you can put up based on your property type?

Boathouses are the most expensive property type while dorms and tents are the cheapest.
